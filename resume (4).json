I developed my version of Othello utilizing a javascript stack (React/Redux/Node/Express) with a MySQL database. This project has challenged me to make difficult design decisions and learn from my mistakes constantly. The most helpful concept I have learned from this project is the value of unit testing. I also have learned how to write much cleaner and more modular code by utilizing linting tools.",
